# vagrant launching instruction
change the directory to the vagrant folder, then execute _vagrant up_ to launch your virtual machine.

- execute _vagrant ssh_ to log into it. 
- execute _exit_ to log out at the shell prompt.  
- execute _vagrant halt_ turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything). If you do this, you'll need to run vagrant up again before you can log into it.
